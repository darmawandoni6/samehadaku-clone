However, the couple's blissful life is suddenly interrupted when Takaihito, the top contender for the imperial throne, sends Kiyoka on a dangerous mission.\n\nTraveling with Miyo to the remote household of his parents, Kiyoka must investigate unusual reports of demons in the region. Meanwhile, Miyo tries to gain the approbation of her callous mother-in-law, Fuyu, who refuses to recognize her as a family member.\n\nAfter Kiyoka repels an attack by the Gifted Communion, a subversive sect of special abilities wielders, he returns to the capital alongside his fiancée. As the looming threat against the imperial authority intensifies, Kiyoka must thwart the Gifted Communion's plans to protect Miyo and everyone he holds dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He soon finds himself playing mahjong, but his whole life takes a dramatic turn when he is forced to play the game with a criminal group. Even though the odds seem against him, Kei is able to outmatch the others. Instead of claiming his reward in cash, however, he decides to take an abducted girl named Amina under his wing.\n\nDue to Kei's skills and cold playstyle, the mysterious Hideharu Seki takes an interest in him, introducing him to mahjong parlors and new potential opponents. But when matched up against an experienced player named Doujima, Kei is severely outskilled and only narrowly escapes going into serious debt. If he wants to protect his new life with Amina, Kei must find a way to outwit these shady characters and come out on top in every game he plays.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The tiny department, consisting of Takao and her sole resident Yuu \"Kotori\" Takanashi, treats complex cases that most other departments within the hospital cannot resolve on their own.\n\nThe mystery-obsessed Takao always tries to insert herself into cases that capture her fancy—much to the dismay of her colleagues and the police. Even if her meddling creates more problems for the hospital and those around her, none can deny the brilliance that the young department head exhibits as she weaves a diagnosis together. No matter the specialty, no case is impossible for Takao and a somewhat reluctant Takanashi to solve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite arriving in an unfamiliar land, he realizes he can still connect to an online shop named Shangri-La, which he frequented back in Japan, to order almost anything. Not long after, Kenichi comes across a town and, using Shangri-La, decides to become a merchant in the settlement.\n\nBy selling products from Earth, he is quickly able to make a living for himself while gaining acquaintances and the attention of local companies. However, the man just wants to live a quiet life without nuisances and leaves the town to build a cabin in a nearby forest. Though interrupted from time to time, there is nothing that can stop Kenichi from having his peaceful days.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although they have never encountered aliens before, Yuuhi is desperate to meet one as he believes that an alien has stolen his important item called the \"Earthdamar.\"\n\nOne day, while searching for extraterrestrial creatures, Yuuhi and Yuamu find a strange spot in the forest where many trees have fallen, forming a scenery similar to a crop circle. As they venture further, they discover a mysterious spaceship and enter it out of curiosity. To their surprise, they come across Yudias Velgear, an alien from the Velgear Star Cluster. As it turns out, Yudias is seeking to learn about Rush Duel—a card game popular among elementary school students—as he believes that it will save his home from a long war.\n\nWith the siblings agreeing to teach Yudias about Rush Duel, they eventually realize that their first contact with an alien may not be a random coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

That clock is overseen by three clock keepers—each representing the past, present, and future. Despite this, an unforeseen event causes mayhem, with students rapidly aging and the academy's infrastructure falling apart.\n\nNene Yashiro and Kou Minamoto seek help from Hanako-kun, embarking on a new adventure to find those responsible for this mess. However, what they uncover is more than just the culprits' identity. As hidden truths are revealed and new vows are established, the academy students and its apparitions find themselves in a game of fate, where the living fight to free themselves from its grasp.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Tomura Sawyer works as a courier in the higher areas, saving money for his little brother, Haru, who suffers from Smoky Moon Disease - a sickness produced by the smoke and polution from the lower areas. The two siblings dream of moving to the higher, cleaner areas to treat this disease.\n\nTomura takes a gamble to do the impossible: to participate in the TV program \"Run for Money\" and to win against all the other contestants even if he doesn't have the Chrono Bracelet required for it. A producer of said program by the name of Harvest seems to take an interest in Tomura's determination to participate, so she gifts him the Bracelet and allows him to participate. In this glorified game of Tag, Tomura Sawyer must last longer than anyone else without being touched by the enemies in this game — the Hunters.",

      "synopsis": "Tsukasa Akeuraji always dreamed of becoming a competitive solo figure skater, but starting too late in life meant his ambitions never got off the ground. Now barely scraping by, he takes on an assistant coach job, resigned to a future far from the one he once imagined.\n\nBefore his first day, Tsukasa meets Inori Yuitsuka, a shy fifth grader sneaking into the rink to practice. Captivated by figure skating, but held back by her mother's overprotectiveness and her own self-doubt, Inori has never been encouraged to pursue her passion until she encounters Tsukasa. Beneath her personality lies great potential, waiting to be unlocked with the right guidance.\n\nMoved by Inori's determination to change and reminded of his own struggles, Tsukasa offers to coach and help her chase the dream she has been too afraid to voice. While the road ahead is long and filled with unfamiliar challenges and rival skaters, Inori dedicates herself to the art and strives to one day reach the Olympics and become a medalist. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
